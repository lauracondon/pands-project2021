# 1. Introduction

This github repository contains my final project for the 2021 Programming and Scripting module for GMIT's HDip in Science in Computing (Data Analytics).

Along with this README which will explain the project in detail, this repository contains the following: 

- data-visualizations - this folder contains all png files outputted by analysis.py.
- analysis.py - this Python file contains all the code used to analyse the iris dataset.
- iris.data - the version of the Fisher Iris dataset used for this project [1]. 
- summary.txt - this text file contains various numerical summaries of the variables in the     iris dataset as outputted by analysis.py. 

# 2. Summary of the Fisher Iris Data Set

The Fisher Iris data set is a multivariate data set consisting of a total of one hundred and fifty samples of iris flowers. Fifty samples were collected from each of three different species of iris (iris setosa, iris virginica and iris versicolor) by Edgar Anderson. Four attributes are recorded for each sample - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width - as well as the class identifier (the species of the iris). All measurements are given in centimeters [1]. 

R.A. Fisher first published this dataset in the article 'The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems' in 1936. In it, Fisher uses the dataset to create a linear discriminant model in order to classify the three different species of iris. Anderson also published an article in 1936, entitled 'The Species Problem in Iris' in which he uses the information from the dataset, in combination with additional research, to hypothesize that iris versicolor is an amphidiploid hybrid of iris setosa and iris virginica [2]. This hypothesis was confirmed by Yoong Lim et. al in 2007 in the article 'Parental Origin and Genome Evolution in the Allopolyploid Iris versicolor' [3]. 

Since its publication, Fisher's iris dataset has become tremendously popular for use in machine learning and statistics. According to Wiley Online Library, it has been cited in other publications 7,422 times [5].  

Use of this dataset is not without issue, however, and there are errors that were incorporated into its reproduced versions which went unnoticed for many years. Notably, the version uploaded to the University of California at Irvine's machine learning repository contains two errors, as first noted by Besdek et. al [6].  These errors are now acknowledged by the UCI on their website [7]. Additionally some biologists have argued that iris flowers don't actually have sepals at all and instead have tepals [8]. That argument is best left to them but it is an interesting aside to a near ubiquitous dataset. 

# 3. How to Run analysis.py

If you would like to run analysis.py on your own Windows machine, you will need to have the following installed: 

1. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - a Python distribution platform that comes preinstalled with the basic libaries you need for data science and machine learning. 
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)- a desktop code editor 

To run simply:
1. Clone the repository to your machine by following the steps in Gitgub's [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). Note that you will also need to download [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

    OR 

    download the repository as a zip file by clicking the green 'Code' button.  

2. Open the resulting folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Navigate to analysis.py within the folder and click run. 

Alternatively you can also run Python directly from the Windows Command Line, and skip downloading Visual Studio Code, by navigating to the folder where you saved the repository and entering python analysis.py. 

# 4. Code Explanation

In this section, youâ€™ll find a step by step breakdown of the code used in analysis.py.

**Step 1 - Import required libraries and the iris dataset**

```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
Python comes with a range of ready to use inbuilt commands but it also allows for the importation of libraries in order to increase its capabilities. The following modules and libraries are used in analysis.py:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. It prides itself on being "fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use" [1]. In analysis.py pandas is used to import the iris dataset and to create the numeric summaries outputted to summary.txt. 
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - a Python library used to create data visualizations. According to its slogan it "makes easy things easy and hard things possible" [2]. In analysis.py matplotlib is used to create and save scatterplots and is used to perform various actions on seaborn plots including adding titles and saving to png. 
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) - a Python library used to create data visualizations. It is based on Matploblib but its more streamlined approach allows you to "focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them" [3]. In analysis.py it is used to create histograms, boxplots, violinplots and to plot pairs of variables using pairplot.

```
iris = pd.read_csv("iris.data", names = ["sepal length", "sepal width", "petal length", "petal width", "class"]) 
```
Fisher's Iris dataset is read into the analysis.py as a DataFrame, so that various subdivisions, calculations and data visualizations can be performed on it [4]. Using 'names =', names are assigned to each of the five columns in the dataset in order to make them easy to work with in the code [5].

**Step 2 - Set default style**

```
colors = ["#595959", "#5f9ed1", "#ff800e"]
sns.set_palette(sns.color_palette(colors))
sns.set_style("dark")
```

Here different style attributes are assigned to the graphs to be created. A custom colour palette is created for the seaborn graphs [6]. The colours chosen are taken from tableau's color blind 10 palette [7]. 

Seaborn also comes with numerous inbuilt colour palettes including pastel, dark and their own variation on colorblind which can be assigned using set_palette [8]. 

Set style is used here to add a dark background to all graphs in order to provide increased contrast with the markers, histograms etc [9]. Other preconfigured options include white, whitegrid, darkgrid and ticks.

**Step 3 - Summarise the Dataset**

```
describe = iris.describe()
```
Pandas comes with a number of handy commands that can perform complex calculations on datasets with ease. Here '.describe()' is used to perform summary calculations on all numeric variables [10]. 
```
all_class_mean = iris.groupby(["class"])[["sepal length","sepal width","petal length", "petal width"]].mean() 
print(all_class_mean)
```
By grouping the variables, calculations can be performed on each class [11]. In this case, the mean value of each attribute for each species of iris is returned. This is a good way to get a sense of what the key differences between them are. 

There are a wide range of common calculations used in data analysis [12] that can be easily perfomed using this method as demonstrated in analysis.py [13]. 

```
tfile = open('summary.txt', 'w')
tfile.write("\n")
[...]
tfile.write("\n\nOverview of All Variables:\n")
tfile.write("\n")
tfile.write(describe.to_string())
```
In order to save the calculations so they can be easily viewed later, they are outputted to a designated text file using write. The various calculations performed above, all create a new DataFrame containing the result. As they are a DataFrame they must be converted to a string using 'to.string()' before they can be written to a text file [14]. New line ('\n') is used to improve the readability of the outputted text file.

The file is opened in write mode, rather than append, so that each time the program is run the text file is overwritten [15]. This is helpful as if you were to edit the dataset by for example adding new rows, the summary data file would change accordingly when analysis.py is next run. 

**Step 4 - Histogram with Kernel Density Estimate**

```
plt.rc("grid", linestyle="dotted", color="gray", alpha = 0.7)
plt.grid()
ax = sns.histplot(data = iris, x = "sepal width", hue = "class", kde = True, bins = 25, element = "step") 
plt.title("Sepal Width Histogram with Kernel Density Estimate", weight = "bold")
plt.savefig("data-visualizations/histogram - sepal width with density.png") 
plt.show()
```

Using seaborn, histograms for each of the four numeric variables are created [16]. Histograms are a common way to visualize distributions in data. 

These histograms are multivariate as each of the three classes of iris are represented on the same graph. Using ' hue = "class"' each class is assigned a different colour - taken from the colour palette applied earlier [17]. 

A kernel density estimate (KDE) is added overlapping the histogram. A KDE is a smooth curve estimate of the density of a variable [18]. Seaborn provides an easy way to combine the two in one figure by simply including 'kde = True'. As there is quite a bit of overlap in some of the figures, efforts have been made to make the data easier to read by increasing the number of bins in the histogram and by setting the element to step so that bars overlap as one 'block' with decreased opacity [19]. Gridlines are also added to try to increase the readibility. 

The resulting histograms are both displayed to the user one at a time in a pop up window and saved to the designated folder 'data-visualizations' for later viewing [20]. As with the summary text file, if the data was changed in the iris.data file the next time analysis.py was run the figures would be overwritten with the new output.

**Step 5 - Scatterplots**

```
set_1 = iris[iris["class"] == "Iris-setosa"]
set_2 = iris[iris["class"] == "Iris-versicolor"]
set_3 = iris[iris["class"] == "Iris-virginica"]
```
Scatterplots are.... Before we can create scatterplots using the dataset, it first needs to be divided into sets based off each class of iris. This is because..

``` 
plt.rc("grid", linestyle = "dotted", color = "gray", alpha = 0.7)
plt.grid()

plt.plot(set_1["petal length"], set_1["petal width"], ".", color = "#595959", label = "setosa")
plt.plot(set_2["petal length"], set_2["petal width"], ".",  color = "#5f9ed1", label = "versicolor")
plt.plot(set_3["petal length"], set_3["petal width"], ".",  color = "#ff800e", label = "virginica")

plt.xlabel("petal length")
plt.ylabel("petal width")
plt.title("Scatterplot of Petal Width vs. Petal Length", weight = "bold")

plt.legend()
plt.savefig("data-visualizations/scatterplot - petal width v length.png")
plt.show() 
```
We need to specify to individually specify what classes we want included in our scatterplot. Within this code, different styles can be assigned to each. There are -- different types of marker style that can be used including +... Here "." is used for each as its smaller size means there is less overlap of markers. The colour is specified, in line with the colours used for the seaborn palette. 

These scatterplots are plotted entirely with matplotlib. While seaborn will automatically generate axis labels and a legend based off the input, in matplotlib there presence has to be specified. While this increases the amount of code required, the upside is that it makes these attributes easily editable, removable and understandable.

**Step 6 - Pairplot**


```
sns.pairplot(iris, hue = "class", markers = [".", ".", "."], plot_kws = {"alpha": 0.6, "s": 80, "edgecolor": "k"}, height = 2) 
plt.savefig("data-visualizations/pairplot.png")
plt.show()
```
Pairplot is an excellent way to easily generate a variety of plots from the dataset. In this pairplot, a figure containing -- is generated. 

All that needs to be included to use pairplot is the name of the dataset and the hue specifier but here additional code is included to specify the style of the output in order to improve readability and ensure consistency with the other plots. USing markers and plot_kws the style of the marker is set. Alpha refers to their opacity, 's' to and 'edgecolour' adds a black outline to each marker. The height of each plot is specified. As there are a lot of plots within the same figure, they do become compressed as a result. There is also many different axes sizes within the same figure which makes it harder to read at a glance. Nonetheless pairplot is an extremely handy tool to generate multiple subplots easily. There are a lot of variations you can do with it, including ---

It will take slightly longer to run than other plots as well. For a small dataset like the Fisher iris one this isn't too much of an issue. When working with larger sets, less rows could be included in the output to give a snapshot overview instead of the whole or the dataset could be further divided instead by year perhaps.. thus helping to speed up the operation of pairplot..

*Step 7 - Boxplot and Violinplots*

```
plt.rc("grid", linestyle = "dotted", color = "gray", alpha = 0.7)
plt.grid()
sns.boxplot(data = iris, palette = "colorblind")
plt.title("Boxplot of Iris Variables", weight = "bold")
plt.savefig("data-visualizations/boxplot - iris.png")
plt.show()
```



```
plt.rc("grid", linestyle = "dotted", color = "gray", alpha = 0.7)
plt.grid()
sns.violinplot(x = "class", y = "sepal length", data = iris)
plt.title("Violinplot of Sepal Length by Class", weight = "bold")
plt.savefig("data-visualizations/violinplot by sepal length - iris.png")
plt.show()
```
