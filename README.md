The Fisher Iris Data Set - A Summary

The Fisher Iris data set is a multivariate data set consisting of a total of one hundred and fifty samples of iris flowers. Fifty samples were collected from each of three different species of iris (iris setosa, iris virginica and iris versicolor) by Edgar Anderson. Four attributes are recorded for each sample - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width as well as the class idenitifier (the species of the iris). All measurements are given in centimeters.[1]

R.A. Fisher first published this dataset in the article 'The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems' in 1936. In it, Fisher uses the dataset to create a linear discriminant model in order to classify the three different species of iris. Anderson also published an article in 1936, entitled 'The Species Problem in Iris' in which he uses the information from the dataset, in combination with additional research, to hypothesis that iris versicolor is an amphidiploid hybrid of iris setosa and iris virginica [2]. This hypothesis was confirmed by Yoong Lim et. al in 2007 in the article 'Parental Origin and Genome Evolution in the Allopolyploid Iris versicolor'[3]. 

Since it's publication, Fisher's iris dataset has become trememedously popular for use in machine learning and statistics. According to Wiley Online Library, it has been cited in other publications 7,422 times [5]. Not to mention the countless projects done using this dataset. 

Use of this dataset is not without issue, however, and there are errors that were incorporated into its reproduced versions which went unnoticed for many years. Notably, the version uploaded by the University of California at Irvine's to their machine learning repository contains two errors as first noted by Besdek et. al [6] - these errors are now acknowledged by UCI itself on their website [7]. Additionally some biologists have argued that iris flowers don't actually have sepals at all and instead have tepals [8] - but we'll leave that argument to them!
